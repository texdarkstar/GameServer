    equipment
        make Nicolas catalog all CSC items.... Mwahahahahahauahaha

        armor (durability ratings or something? Doesn't make sense for it to be invincible. This needs to confer with the core rules too.)
        guns/knives/weapons (recoil, auto, special mods like laser sights, gyros, etc.)
        misc gear (Probably have no use at all, just tokens or something (Ohh! I have a hand computer!)
        credit/money/bank accounts/augrams/silgrams (use multiple currencies?)

    npcs
        npc will be special mud mobiles that do nothing at all, but a controller can use @puppet or something to temporarily pupppet an npc.
        maybe the name of the npc they are managing can show in their prompt

    combat handler
    enviroment handler
    skills/attributes
    color says

    commands
        @assign
        finger/whois
        order
        perform
        sheet
        stat
        award
        config


    stat <character/mob>
    order <mob> <action>
    finger <player>
    whois <player>  # an alias of finger
    perform <stat> + <skill>
    perform <stat>
    roll <number>D<sides> <+/-><dm>

    @assign <sheet> <player>
    award <boon/bane> <player>
    config <setting>

    config will allow a player to toggle some settings, such as:
        dot commands: prefix all commands with a dot (.), any non command is sent as a chat message (on/off)
        prompt: display a prompt (on/off)
        autospend: automatically spend boon dice when possible. No effect on bane dice, as they are already spent automatically (on/off)


    if I come up with any more I'll write them down here.
