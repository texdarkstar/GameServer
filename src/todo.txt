new todo:
    need to put this into the repo

    commands:
        @assign
        finger/whois
        order
        perform
        roll
        sheet
        stat
        award

    npc will be special mobs that do nothing at all, but a controller can user "order" to have it do stuff,
        which is basically a specialized version of @force, which targets players, not mobs.

    stat <character/mob>
    order <mob> <action>
    finger <player>
    whois <player>
    perform <stat> + <skill>
    roll <number>D<sides> <+/-><dm>

    @assign <sheet> <player>
    award <boon/bane> <player>
