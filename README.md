# Welcome!

This is a telnet server for playing paper and pencil RPGs, built off of the Evennia codebase.
This is technically not a MUD, although it uses a MUD codebase.
Intended to be able to manage lots of different game systems, but for now building it to run Traveller.

Evennia's documentation is here:
